# Ruby, why do you hate me?

Ruby core api changes incompatibly about 3 times a week. Just kidding, maybe
once a week.

Sarcasm aside, shit needs to work. Newer code uses newer ruby apis without
knowing it. I support old rubies, so I need newer api features working in older
rubies.

Folks on CentOS 5 get Ruby 1.8.5 or 1.8.6, and that lacks things like
String#start_with? and Regexp#union... etc. I SUPPORT YOU, FRIEND.
